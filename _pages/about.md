Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champagin](https://illinois.edu/). My research interest is wireless sensing, specifically next-generation sensing platforms like the millimeter-wave radar!

I started my academic journey at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), where I (and my team) built an entire car from scratch! 

I am an avid reader and I love detective stories! I also love building random electronics projects for fun! When I am not reading or tinkering, you might find me toying with my fountain pens!
